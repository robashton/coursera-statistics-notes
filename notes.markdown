# Lesson One

### Definitions


Qualitative?
  - Discrete data point (an enum)
Quantitiative?
  - Continuous data point (a number)

Statistic - a quantity calculated from a sample of data
  - Averages
  - Variation
  - Etc

Population - entire collection of cases
Sample - a subset of the population
Statistic - numerical measure that describes a characteristic of that sample
Parameter - a numerica measure that describes a characteristic of a population


Descriptive - procedures to summarise/organise/simplfy data       - Easy
Inferential - procedures to allow for generalise about the population based on statistics - Hard

Research methods (Week one effectively)
===

Descriptive/Correlational/Experimental

Descriptive - Organise/Summarize the data
Correlational - Examining relationships between variables
Experimental - Randomly assign students to different shedules such as year-round/summer-break and determine if anything is affected
  - This is a branch of correlational surely

[It's the year of statistics!](http://statistics2013.org/)


### Example 1 -  Polio Vaccine

**USA**

 - 20,000 cases per year between 1900-1950
 - 1952 - 60,000 cases
 - Vaccine created, tested for effectiveness
 - Experimental research uses for effectiveness
 - Very classic example 

 - Population: All children in the USA
 - Sample: 4000 children, expanded to 1.8 million :O

We need an independent variable
  - Treatment (Vaccine or Placebo)

There are dependent variables
  - We measure these after the fact
  - Polio diagnosis per child         (0 vs 1)
  - Rate of polio, measure per group  (%)

Double blind: Nobody knows who is getting the real treatment

Results:
  - Rate (per 100,000)
  - Treatment: 28 with polio
  - Control: 71 with polio

Experiments allow us to make causal claims about *why stuff happens*

This requires
  - True independent variables
  - Random and representative samples
  - No confounds (Impossible)
    - Wtf is a confound? (Age of child/socio-economic conditions)
    - Are confounds variables that we're not looking at?
