Statistic - numerical measure that describes a characteristic of that sample
Parameter - a numerica measure that describes a characteristic of a population


Descriptive - procedures to summarise/organise/simplfy data       - Easy
Inferential - procedures to allow for generalise about the population based on statistics - Hard

Research methods (Week one effectively)
===

Descriptive/Correlational/Experimental

Descriptive - Organise/Summarize the data
Correlational - Examining relationships between variables
Experimental - Randomly assign students to different shedules such as year-round/summer-break and determine if anything is affected
  - This is a branch of correlational surely
